# **Abstract**
**Background**: Co-translational mRNA decay, where 5’-to-3’ exonucleases follow the last translating ribosome, offers unique insights into mRNA decay and ribosome dynamics. Despite its potential, resources for systematic analysis of 5′P mRNA decay intermediates and associated features, such as ribosome stalls and collisions, are scarce.  
**Findings**: We introduce **5PSeq Explorer**, a web-based platform aggregating 775 uniformly processed 5PSeq datasets across 23 species suitable for exploring ribosome dynamics in vivo at codon, amino acid, and transcript levels.   
**Conclusions**: By integrating normalised counts, structured metadata, and scalable visualisation tools, 5PSeq Explorer provides a framework for studying the cross-talk between mRNA decay and ribosome dynamics. To ensure reproducibility and accessibility, we offer both a public web interface and a Docker-based local version.
